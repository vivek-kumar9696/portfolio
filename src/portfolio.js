Scraped the news articles from global media platforms using the newsdata.io API and stock market data using yahoo finance API Labelled the articles using VADER sentiment analyzer package and built a transformer based model consisting of pre-trained weights of BERT, RoBERTa and linear layers.Used mean-squared-error as loss function and RMSProp as optimizer. Finally obtained the pearson correlation score of 0.87 between average stock price and sentiment score of a sector to validate the results " ,
